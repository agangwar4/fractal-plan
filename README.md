# Fractal-plan

Some operations with geometric plan to induce a animation with music.

#### DANGEER!

All below things is mad stuff. Caution with your saneness.

## Dependency

You do **need** of:
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

To install pygame in linux debian-based you have two options:

  * Using **apt**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-pygame
    ```
 
  * Using **pip**:
    ```bash
    sudo pip install pygame
    ```

## Usage

This a beautiful thing. Why you don't only execute this? Fucking explanation. Just execute!

__There's also action keys!__

| Key  |      Action       |
|------| ----------------  |
| ESC  |  Exit             |
|  +   |  Plus vertex      |
|  -   |  Minus vertex	   |

## History

Self-destruction. What you are doing here? **DANGER!**

## Roadmap 
  - [ ] Find the answer of universe. (easily)
  	- [ ] Implement fractal geometric equations using complex numbers.
  	- [ ] Do evolution algorithm with number theory and numeric analysis
  	- [ ] Try understanding what are i'm trying do.
  - [X] Pull random musics of the user database
